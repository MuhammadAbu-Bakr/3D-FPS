# 🎯 First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game Prototype – Unity

This is a **learning-focused FPS game project** built using **Unity**, where I'm exploring and implementing the core mechanics of a first-person shooter. The current build focuses on setting up a smooth and functional **FPS controller** including movement, camera look, and crouch mechanics — all using Unity's new Input System.

## 🚀 Current Features

### 🕹️ Player Movement System
- ✅ Walk and Sprint modes with configurable speeds
- ✅ Smooth Crouch system with height adjustment and obstacle detection
- ✅ Physics-based movement using `CharacterController`
- ✅ Gravity, jump force, and smooth movement transitions

### 🎥 Camera and Controls
- ✅ Mouse look for camera control
- ✅ Smooth vertical and horizontal look
- ✅ Cursor lock for immersive FPS control

### ⚙️ Input System
- ✅ Implemented using **Unity's New Input System**
- ✅ Supports modular, scalable input handling

## 🧠 Key Components

- **`InputMotor.cs`** – Handles player movement, input logic, and physics
- **`PlayerLook.cs`** – Manages camera rotation and mouse input
- **Crouch System**
  - Adjusts player height smoothly
  - Prevents standing up if blocked above (obstacle detection)
- **Movement Parameters**
  - Configurable speed, sprint multiplier, jump force, gravity
  - Crouch speed reduction for realism

---

## 🧪 Features In Progress / Coming Soon

- 🌍 Map and terrain system with basic level design
- 🔫 Weapon handling (shooting, aiming, reloading)
- 🧠 AI enemies for target practice
- 💥 Health and damage system
- 🧭 Minimap, HUD, and UI overlays
- 🎮 Game loop and win/lose mechanics

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Used

- **Unity 2022+**
- **C#**
- **Unity New Input System**
- **Character Controller**
- **Physics & Raycasting**

## 📘 What I’m Learning

- Building first-person controller systems from scratch
- Working with Unity’s physics and `CharacterController`
- Smooth camera rotation with mouse input
- Input abstraction using Unity's Input System
- Real-time crouch and sprint mechanics with smooth transitions
- Player interaction systems and level design planning

## 📌 Project Status

`🧪 In Progress – Core FPS controller completed`

This is an early-stage, learning-focused game prototype. Many features like maps, weapons, AI, and UI are planned in future updates.
